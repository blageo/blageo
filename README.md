## **🔭 I’m currently working on...**

  Professionally, I've been focused on automation solutions to help my workflow at my job in IT.
  
  Personally, I've recently purchased some home server hardware and am experimenting with setting up a linux homelab environment. The focus will be mainly on media streaming/indexing/automation and virtualization to practice cybersecurity/penetration testing skills but my hardware is beefy and I expect to expand my aspirations for the homelab.
  
### **🌱 I’m currently learning...**

  C++, Python, React, SQL, DevOps, Linux, Networking, Security
  
### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on...

  I've never gotten involved with an open source project before so I'm excited to collaborate on whatever I can get my hands on. I'll need to do research to find a good way to get started on open-source collaboration since it's very new to me.
  
### 🤔 I’m looking for help with...

  Backend development and lower level programming in general. Advice on getting involved with open-source collaboration as a beginner. Any best practices advice would be very welcome as I don't have much enterprise scale or collaborative coding experience and am self-taught. Because of this, I'm very interested in ways to make my code more performant, clean, and maintainable.

### ⭐ Fun fact...

  Thanks for making it this far! Outside of IT interests, I love to make music and have played in multiple bands as a singer and instrumentalist. At one point before I started pursing a career in IT, I was a professional musician (broke but primary income). I also love to ski and mountain bike.
